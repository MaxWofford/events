# Event Protocol

This document contains our checklist that must be completed for all events run directly by Hack Club.

## Preparation
- [ ] Link to our [code_of_conduct][code_of_conduct] in marketing materials.
- [ ] Make sure everyone is aware that showing up at the event means that they consent to having their picture taken and put online (ie. in a Facebook photo album on our Hack Club page).

[code_of_conduct]: https://github.com/hackclub/blob/master/CONDUCT.md

## Day Of 
- [ ] Place a sign on the entrance of the venue with the name of the event and the phone number of one of the organizers (in case people who arrive late need to get in or otherwise reach an organizer).
- [ ] Introduce the event and present the code of conduct to the attendees. Don't spend time going into dtails, instead paraphrase "The code of conduct" essentially says, respect other people and do not make them feel uncomfortable".
- [ ] Make it clear which organizer to talk to if an attendee is not satisfied, feeling uncomfortable, or would like to provide feedback in general.
